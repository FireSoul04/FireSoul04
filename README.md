## Welcome to my Github account

I'm a full-time italian student of Computer science and engeneering at University of Bologna.

I like videogames, in my account there are some games made by myself, mainly using C++.

I studied computer programming since highschool, now the languages I know are:
* C
* C++
* C#
* Java
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Bash scripting

Meanwhile, I taught myself C++, SDL2 and Cmake for game development and i consider C++ my main language for personal projects.

I read Robert C. Martin Clean Code and Clean Architecture. From them I learned better how a project structure can change the productivity of a project and how to build a good project.
